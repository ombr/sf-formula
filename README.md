# Formula Evaluator

This project provides a powerful and flexible formula evaluation engine.

## Demo Website

An interactive demo website is available to test formula evaluations.

First, ensure the library is built by running:
```bash
npm run build
```
(or `npm run build:demo`)

To launch the demo, run:
```bash
npm run serve:demo
```
This will open the demo in your web browser.

The demo uses CodeMirror for an enhanced formula input experience.
